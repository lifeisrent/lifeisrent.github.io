## 🍕 Code, Rain, and Pizza

If we had to explain who we are in three words, they would be:

> **Code. Rain. Pizza.**

Why?  
Because we **code in the rain**,  
we **fund our dreams**,  
and we **eat pizza with pride**.

Sometimes open source.  
Sometimes open umbrellas.  
Always open to another slice.

We write code, build cool things, and when funding comes in—  
we celebrate the only way developers should:

> With hot pizza and merge commits.

Welcome to the Git Rich Club.  
Grab a slice, commit often, and stay dry ☔.
